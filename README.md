# OpenGL-3D-Landscape
The project involves a 3D Landscape. We can add houses and windmills to the landscape with menu options. We can switch between Day and Night modes. It contains trees as well as an Aircraft with its Runway. The landscape can be viewed by using FPS (First Person Shooter) style camera movement. It also includes an Aircraft Simulation. In Perspective Viewing, we can simulate walking on the landscape with the use of keyboard functions and mouse functions. This is implemented using the FPS (First Person Shooter) approach. The landscape is created with a lighting effect from the Sun.
